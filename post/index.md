Code your own vue is a series of post that is going to show you how create your own vue for learning purposes, the implementation of functionalities try to be most simple as can be.

### The ideas of this title are:
- Get a **better** understanding of the main concepts of popular frameworks or libraries like vue, react, angular and so on.
- Be a cool coder that has did your own vue... a simple one like a cheap toy, but is your own vue.

Consider that I can be wrong or vue possibly handle some concepts in other ways, you can use the comments section if you think I'm wrong.

### What you need to know:
- Javascript
- DOM
- Vue v2

I want to be concise, but also I will add some references links to documentation if I use something that someone who start learning javascript may don't know.
